								<p>My name is Ron [Middle-Name-Redacted] Swanson, and I created this Remix website. This website reflects my first experience working with html and other digital media programs.</p>
								<p>I am a senior in the Creative Writing program at Virginia Tech, so I took Writing and Digital Media as a part of my core curriculum. From this class, I hoped to learn how to create a professional website for myself and gather the tools I'll need to work on digital publications.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Goals</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="pen.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My primary goal as an undergraduate has been to master the art of poetry writing. I have taken many classes that will help me get to that goal. These classes include workshops and literature and language classes that have made me a better reader and writer of poetry. I am confident that I will leave Virginia Tech having taken advantage of these tools. Although I have much more to learn, I have become the best I can be as an undergraduate poet, thanks to the many courses and educational opportunities offered to me by this English department. </p>

<p>Writing and Digital Media has not been a workshop or a literary course. I will likely not take any classes like this as I continue into my post-graduate education. However, I am confident that the tools I learn from this class will carry with me as a young professional in the 21st Century. </p>

<p>From the start of the semester, I envisioned myself creating a website for myself as a career poet. I thought this website would include a blog, a list of publications, a contact page, and a resume/CV. A website like this would give me a digital presence to which I can reference on professional applications throughout my career. Many contemporary poets have such websites, such as <a href="http://claudiarankine.com">Claudia Rankine</a>, <a href="http://www.jamaalmay.com">Jamaal May</a>, and our very own <a href="http://www.nikki-giovanni.com">Nikki Giovanni</a>. I am currently in development of a website for myself.</p>

<p>I have also been the Editor-in-Chief for an on-campus literary publication this year. As the editor, I have taken the publication from print, to online PDF, to online journal. I appreciated the opportunity to print a physical magazine, but have found that I can reach a wider audience by digitizing the magazine. This involved learning how to code effectively, so that I can optimize the magazine for on-screen appeal. I’ve learned that the experience of reading something online should be different than reading a printed journal. I also talked with many people in my organization about the advantages of digitizing this magazine. One colleague correctly pointed out that a PDF is too large a file size for our consumers. It will slow down the loading time of our page, which is not ideal. Another colleague argues that PDFs are not searchable, so people will not be able to find their specific pieces by Googling their names or titles. Also, PDFs are not readable by software that assists blind users, so our magazine would be unavailable to some disabled communities. All-in-all, my magazine should be digitized properly. This is a major project for us, which is why it is not complete yet. But the IT staff in my organization has been helping me develop a unique and user-friendly online site for my magazine, which should publish its first wholly digital edition in June.</p>

	<h1>T-Shaped Podcast</h1>

<p>For our T-Shaped Podcast, we decided to create a fake website that is an alternative to LinkedIn. We called it Nucleus, and it was (fake) set up to fix all of the problems that LinkedIn currently has. We came up with this idea, because it seemed to be a necessary tool for the VT-Shaped graduate. Our website would not just highlight one major hirable skill-set. We were hoping to create a professional networking site that understood the motto of the VT-Shaped student: that a well-rounded knowledge-base, skill-set, and career plan makes for a valuable member of society. So, our website's key feature is that it has an option for multiple resumes. This way, the individual could highlight different aspects of their interests and experiences based on who was viewing their profile. </p>
<p>I really believed in Neucleus, but I understand the ways in which we fell short on the VT-Shaped individual. None of us really understood the assignment as a reiteration of the VT-shaped ideals. We wanted to highlight our own idea with the VT-Shaped program in the shadow, when it should have been in the foreground. If we were to redo it, I think we'd center this new professional networking site around the VT-shaped individual. If we had addressed the ideas of the program with less layers of anti-LinkedIn and pro-Nucleus, we would have had a much more successful T-Shaped podcast. </p>


<h1> V-Shaped Video </h1>
							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3tyFqGAmStQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

							<p>For our V-Shaped Video, we decided to do "72 Questions with Virginia Tech Alumni," which is similar to the Vogue online video series, "72 Questions." They follow celebrities through their homes and ask them 72 random questions. In the Vogue videos, they do not break the shot once, so we figured it would be a simple shoot with minimal editing, since it's all shot in one take.</p>
							<p>In the video, Mo and I both pretended to be several years out of our undergraduate career. The questions were guided so that they could be about the VT-Shaped student, and how the program helped us during and after college. I am going into a graduate program in creative writing, so my answers were largely about how the VT-Shaped student program helped me to get accepted into this program, and how the skills from my VT-shaped experience have helped me in graduate school.</p>
							<p>For me, the VT-Shaped student program has presented itself as opportunities like editing on-campus literary publications and teaching creative writing to fourth-graders through the Community Writing class. So, I talked about how teaching and editing experience is valuable to a graduate student in my field.</p>
							<p>I believe that this video is more successful than the podcast at addressing the VT-Shaped student program. However, we had many technical difficulties with the video that made it less presentable than the podcast. None of us understood how to use video-editing software, so we essentially didn't edit it. I tried for a long time to make the audio clearer, by cutting the wind and increasing volume in the quieter parts. The result was clearer than the original, but it was still quite unclear.</p>
							<p>If we were to re-do this video, I would have taken more time to learn how to use video-editing software so that I could have properly edited the video. This would have allowed the audio to be clearer, the camera to be less shakey, and the message of the VT-Shaped student program to be more understandable.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Reflection</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="reflectionflame.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>To build this Remix website, I had to rethink my convictions about digital writing, intellectual property, and my role as a Virginia Tech student.</p>
								<p>My own work composing this website has transformed my ideas about digital writing—a discipline I would have never tried before taking this class. I understand now that digital writing is about optimizing the content on the screen. As a digital writer, I have to ask, “How am I guiding the viewer through this page? What do they need to see?”</p>
								<p>This balance between content and visual structure is important for anybody who wants to have a career in the 21st Century. I am now able to create a website for myself, or better showcase the creative works I’m tasked to publish as the editor of a literary publication.</p>
								<p>I am truly surprised that I enjoy composing in HTML. I expected to run into many more problems than I did. I found that coding is much simpler and more accessible than I ever anticipated. I think that even if I walked away from HTML for five or ten years, I could easily pick it up again when I need it. </p>
								<p>I was most interested building this website as a trial for other websites I’ll have to build later in my life. I hope to pass on this knowledge to future editors of my magazine, and other professionals who would like to create a website for themselves.</p>

								<p>Learning about the VT-Shaped individual has enhanced my Virginia Tech experience. I was already living and learning within the program. My major is Creative Writing, but I have taken classes in Political Science, Sociology, Philosophy, and Math, among others. My interests are diverse. As I explore these interests, I learn so much about the world that I would not have had access to otherwise.</p>
<p> I graduate from Virginia Tech in a few days, ready to go on to my graduate program in Creative Writing. Most people familiar with fine arts graduate programs believe that students should take a break between undergraduate and graduate education. The idea is that we must have lived experiences from which we gather content for our artistic endeavors. There is merit to this idea. But as a graduating Hokie, I am confident that I have lived experiences and ideas. </p>
</p>Because of the VT-Shaped program, I was able to study abroad. My time outside of the United States helped me to broaden my worldview and understand cultural differences first-hand. Because of the VT-Shaped program, I have been given the opportunity to teach creative writing to fourth-grade students. I gathered invaluable experience as a teacher, but also connected to the Blacksburg community in a more personal and revealing setting than I had seen the town before. Because of the VT-Shaped program, I am the Editor-in-Chief of a literary magazine. In this role, I learned how to lead, how to work in a team to complete a project, and how to provide opportunities for creative outlets. I have had a well-rounded college experience, because of the VT-Shaped program. I look forward to carrying these values with me as I enter into the post-graduate and professional world.
